Documentation for the PKT project

## Wallet setup
There are currently two wallets which you can choose from, the easiest to set up is
[PKT Electrum](./electrum) which has a Graphical UI and supports Windows, Mac and Linux.

You can also setup [PKT Wallet](./pktd/pktwallet) which is command line only but has greater
scalability and privacy features.
## Mining
PKT is mined using the PacketCrypt bandwidth hard mining algorithm. You can learn how
to mine on the [Mining](./mining) page.
## Running a pktd instance
You can setup a pktd instance using the instructions on [pktd](./pktd).

## Help and Community
